# Advanced HTML & CSS Project

Welcome to the `css_advanced` directory of the `alx_html_css` repository!

This project showcases a deeper understanding of HTML structure and introduces advanced concepts in CSS. It simulates the layout of a typical homepage with multiple sections, including a header, main content, testimonials, and a footer. You'll see semantic HTML tags in action, organized layout, and a structure that prepares the site for future responsive design.

## 🧠 Objective

To create a visually structured and semantically rich webpage using only HTML (no CSS yet), based on a given design specification. This lays the foundation for styling and interactivity in later stages.

## 📁 Files

- `index.html`: Main HTML file structured with semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- `README.md`: This documentation file explaining the project structure, purpose, and usage.

## 🏗️ Features

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Reusable components like header, banner, quote, and footer
- Placeholder images for logos and profile pictures
- Clean and readable code formatting
- Prepares the layout for advanced CSS styling
